# Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

For this assignment we had to create a day planner for normal workday hours.  The planner had to be able to store information in each time slot, so that after the page was refreshed, the information would remain. The planner also had to show the current date and time, and indicate in each time slot whether that slot was in the past, present, or future by its color.
